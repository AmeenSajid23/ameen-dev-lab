1.High-Level programming language
2.Open Source and community driven just like Linux
3.Includes many modules inbuilt
4.Dynamic typed
5.Can be compiled or just-in-time
6.Easy to learn and read
7.Python3 is latest, min 3.8 or later as it's very stable
8.Pip is python package manager
9.File must end with .py to be executable (python3 hello-world.py)
10.Execution happens line by line (linear)
11.The Python Package Index (PyPI) is a repository of software for the Python programming language.

Datatypes

1.String >> Sentence,word,character
2.Integer >> Whole Number (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.. etc)
3.Float >> Decimal number (1.1,2.25... etc)
4.Boolean >> True or False

Conditional Operators:
== - equal to
!= - not equal to
> - greater than
< - less than
>= - greater than or equal to
<= - less than or equal to

Types of Objects in Python3
1.List
2.Tuples
3.Dictionary

STDIN & STDOUT
>>STDIN - Standard Input
>>STDOUT - Standard Output

Common Python Modules:
1.os - Operating system interactions
2.sys - System-specific parameters and functions
3.math - Mathematical functions
4.random - Generate random numbers
5.datetime - Date and time handling
6.json - JSON encoding and decoding
7.re - Regular expressions
8.collections - Specialized container datatypes

Different File Modes:
1.'r' - Read (default mode, file must exist)
    with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
         content = f.read()

2.'w' - Write (creates new file or overwrites existing)
    with open('file.txt', 'w') as f:
         f.write('Hello World')

3.'a' - Append (adds to end of file)
    with open('file.txt', 'a') as f:
         f.write('\nNew line')

4.'x' - Create (creates new file, fails if exists)
    with open('file.txt', 'x') as f:
         f.write('New file content')

5.'b' - Binary (use with r/w/a, e.g., 'rb', 'wb')
    with open('image.png', 'rb') as f:
         binary_data = f.read()

6.'t' - Text (default, e.g., 'rt', 'wt')
    with open('file.txt', 'rt') as f:
         text = f.read()

7.'+' - Read and Write (e.g., 'r+', 'w+')
    with open('file.txt', 'r+') as f:
         content = f.read()
         f.write('Additional content')
